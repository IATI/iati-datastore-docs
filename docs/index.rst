**************

The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) is a global effort to make data about development and humanitarian aid more transparent. 
IATI data is formatted according to the `IATI Standard <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/>`_. 

IATI Datastore Search is a tool which allows users to search IATI activity data published by reporting organisations. The results can be downloaded in IATI XML, JSON, or CSV format.

Datastore Search includes:

`Simple Search <https://datastore.iatistandard.org/>`_ 
   This search behaves like any familiar search engine. Users can search the natural language elements of IATI data for any words or phrases of interest.

`Advanced Search <https://datastore.iatistandard.org/>`_ (using the "Switch to Advanced Search‚Äù button)
   This search allows users to make more complex queries using any IATI element.

`Datastore API <https://developer.iatistandard.org/api-details#api=datastore&operation=iati-identifiers-exist>`_
   Users can also query IATI data using their own code via the API.
