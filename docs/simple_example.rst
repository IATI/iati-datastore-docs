.. _q1: 
1: How do I investigate which countries have had SMART surveys?
-------------------

A data user wants to investigate which countries have had Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys conducted. 

A suitable query would be **"smart survey" ~5**. This will search every narrative IATI element for the words smart and survey, within 5 words of each other. 

The user can explore the results by clicking on individual activities titles. This will take them to a basic summary page for the activity, with the options to download it or view it on d-portal. 

If they are happy with the query, the user can download the full set of results in the EXCEL format, at Activity level. 
Scrolling across to the "recipient_country" and "recipient_region" columns will show the countries and/or regions that benefit from this activity.

If recipient countries and regions are missing for some activities, this may be because they have been declared for individual transactions. 
The user can find this information by downloading the results at transaction level.

.. _q2: 
2: How do I find activites related to diabetes?  
-------------------

A researcher wants to find IATI activities with a focus on diabetes.

They can use the query **diabet\*** to search all narrative IATI elements for relevant activities. This uses the wildcard search operator **\***, meaning it will return results including the words diabetic and diabetes.

The researcher could make this query more specific by using the advanced search. For example, by filtering to activities with the DAC 5 digit sector code 12182, for medical research.
